### Frame Length Cut Calculator

---

This tool determines the minimum number of stock lengths required to cut frame
components while tracking leftover material.

---

#### How the Calculator Works

- Omega frames and corner frames are **optimized independently**.
- The required number of cut ends is calculated from the **total piece count**.

> **Tip:**  
> Selecting part lengths that divide evenly into the available stock length
> will help reduce overall material waste.
