### Panel Foaming Calculator

---

This tool estimates total foam volume, shot time, material weight, and material cost
for standard **rectangular insulation panels** using user-defined geometry and foam
material properties.

---

#### How the Calculator Works

- Foam volume is automatically calculated from the **length, width, and depth** inputs.
- All dimensional inputs represent the **outside dimensions** of the finished panel.
- Foam density and chemical ratio fields are:
  - Pre-filled with default values
  - Editable by the user
  - Optional (defaults will be used if left blank)
- All calculated results are **estimates only** and intended for:
  - Planning
  - Comparison
  - Preliminary material sizing

> **Tip:**  
> Verify panel dimensions and foam material properties against real-world data
