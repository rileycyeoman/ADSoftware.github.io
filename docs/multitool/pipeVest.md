### Vestibule Size & GPM Calculator

---

This calculator evaluates **pipe sizing**, **flow velocity (FPS)**, and **minimum
vestibule clearances** based on the selected pipe size, system flow rate, and
installation conditions.

---

#### How the Calculator Works

- Pipe outside diameter (OD), inside diameter (ID), and internal flow area are
  automatically retrieved from the pipe data table based on the selected
  nominal pipe size.
- Flow velocity (FPS) is calculated using coil flow rate (GPM) and pipe internal
  area. The recommended velocity range is **3–8 FPS**.
- If the calculated velocity falls outside the acceptable range, the selected
  pipe size will be flagged as **Revise**.
- Minimum and maximum allowable GPM values are calculated for the selected pipe
  size based on the velocity limits.
- Vestibule width calculations include allowances for:
  - Elbows
  - Flanged valves (if selected)
  - Offset piping runs (if selected)
  - Frame thickness
