Stepped Panel design foam calcualtion


#### Variables
---
The following are the current variables that are kept constant in the code:
+ $\rho_{steel} = 0.284\frac{lb}{in^3}$, Density of steel 
+ $22ga = 0.03in$, Steel gauge
+ $\text{Thickness} = 2 * Gauge$, Both sides of panel to be subtracted from length  
+ $\rho_{Foam} = 2.5$, Foam Density
+ Foam Ratio: 


#### Formulas
$$ \text{Outer Length} = \text{Length} - \text{Thickness} -  \text{Bend Deduction}$$
